Reflection of my Module 6 &amp; 7 Assignments in CS 350

Artifacts Selected

Module Six Lab: Temperature Sensor and LED Control

Final Project: Embedded System with Sensor Input and Output Control

Summary

These projects were all about connecting software with hardware on a Raspberry Pi. The main goal was to make sensors and LEDs work together through Python code, showing how software logic can control real-world components.

What I Did Well

Funnily enough I don't think I did anything particularly too well on these assignments *from a technical perspective*. The greatest thing I did through these assignments was work through adversity. I was having a lot of technical issues and logistical issues setting up my Raspberry Pi for these assignments but I worked through it with patience determination and a lot of re-reading and troubleshooting. 

Where I Could Improve

The biggest mistake I made during these assignments was actually prior to these assignments. I didn't read thouroughly enough and set myself up for success as well as I could have. I also struggled a lot getting frustrated when things weren't working as I had hoped they would. Patience goes a long way.

Tools and Resources I Used

I relied a lot on the Raspberry Pi and Adafruit documentation, plus the Python GPIO guides. I also used VS Code for development and GitHub for version control. These are definitely tools I’ll keep using for future projects.

Transferable Skills

This project helped me get more confident with Python, hardware troubleshooting(!), and system design. The experience I gained here easily carries over to other areas like IoT, robotics, and embedded systems.

Making It Maintainable

I kept my code modular and commented clearly so it’s easy to update later. The README explains setup and logic, so anyone who revisits it (even me later on) can follow along without confusion.
